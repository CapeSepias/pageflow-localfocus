            Select this Page Type to embed a [LocalFocus](https://www.localfocus.nl/en/) graph.

            LocalFocus lets you create and share animated illustrations for a
            wide range of datasets. [Example](https://localfocus2.appspot.com/551a9626918b3)

            ### In LocalFocus

            To embed one in a story, first login to LocalFocus and find the
            chart in question. Around half-way on the page you'll see two tabs.
            One labelled _Explore_ and the other _Create_. Choose Create.

            The sharing options are displayed as red buttons. Choose for
            **Widget** here. Then copy the value of _Direct Link_. You don't
            need to use the complete Embed code; we take care of that for you.

            ### In Pageflow

            Now onto your story and the Pageflow editor. Login to Pageflow and
            add a new page. For Page Type, choose _LocalFocus_. Then click the
            _Widget_ tab. Paste the _Direct Link_ into the box. The graph
            should render in the preview pane on the right.
